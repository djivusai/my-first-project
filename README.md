# my-first-project
My first GitHub repository for learning Git and GitHub

## Getting Started

This repository is a beginner-friendly project for learning:
- Git basics (commits, branches, merges)
- GitHub workflow (pull requests, issues)
- Collaborative development

## What I've Learned

1. How to create a repository
2. How to edit files on GitHub
3. How to make commits

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or create pull requests to improve this project!

## GitHub Concepts Guide

### Repositories
A repository is a folder for your project's files and version history.
- Create new: Click "+" icon → New repository
- Public vs Private: Choose who can see your code
- Contains: Code, issues, pull requests, wiki

### Commits
A snapshot of your changes with a message explaining what was changed.
```bash
# Example: Making a commit locally
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main
```

### Branches
Separate lines of development to work on features safely.
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **feature branches**: Work on new features without affecting main
- Common naming: `feature/awesome-feature`, `bugfix/critical-bug`

### Pull Requests (PRs)
Propose changes from one branch to another. Used for code review.
1. Create a branch
2. Make changes and commit
3. Create a Pull Request
4. Team reviews and approves
5. Merge into main

### Issues
Track bugs, features, and tasks.
- Use labels: bug, feature, enhancement, documentation
- Link issues to PRs
- Assign to team members

## Useful Shortcuts
- `g + c`: Go to Code
- `g + i`: Go to Issues
- `g + p`: Go to Pull Requests
- `t`: Open file finder
- `?`: Show all keyboard shortcuts
